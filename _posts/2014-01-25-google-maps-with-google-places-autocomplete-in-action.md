A short how to screencast on installation and use of new property editor Google Maps w/ Google Places Autocomplete in Umbraco v7.0.2.

Prerequisites:

* Umbraco v7.0.2 (v7.0.1 will also work)
* Any of the available starter kits

If your map doesn't show up on first use (As can be seen in screencast), be sure to reload the page using ctrl+f5!

Happy watching!
